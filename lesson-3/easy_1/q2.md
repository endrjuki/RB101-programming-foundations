<h3>Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:</h3>

* what is != and where should you use it?

`!=` is a comparison operator that stands for `NOT EQUAL` and will return `true` if comparison is false. Should be used in comparison statements.
e.g. `7 != 8 => true` 

* put ! before something, like !user_name

`!object` returns boolean negation (or opposite) of `object` 
e.g. `!false => true`, `!nil => true`, `!"baby" => false`

* put ! after something, like words.uniq!

`!` after method name is part of the method name. By convention, it means that method is destructive or mutates it's caller, but not necesarrily, it all depends on the implementation of the method.

* put ? before something

`?` before something returns character literal expression
alternatively it could represent ternary `if..else` statement:
`statement ? true : false`

* put ? after something

`?` after a method name is part of the method name. Idiomatically, it implies that the method returns a Boolean object, but not necesarrily. It all depends on the implementation of said method.

* put !! before something, like !!user_name

`!!object` returns boolean equivalent of said object
e.g. `!!true => true`, `!!"adc" => true`, `!!nil => false`
