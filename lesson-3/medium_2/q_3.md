### Question 3

Study the code: what will be displayed and why?

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

What will be displayed:

```
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
```

Why:

On `line 8` `my_string` and `my_array` are being passed to the `tricky_method`. Since Ruby uses a "pass by reference value" strategy, only copies of references are supplied to the method. Ruby can use the copies of the references to modify the original object, but the original references themselves can't be modified from the perspective of the method. 

`line 2`

```
a_string_param += "rutabaga"
```

assignment operation does not modify the original object, it binds the variable to a new object entirely: `pumpkinsrutabaga`, this however doesn't affect the `my_variable` or the object it points to in any way, `my_variable` still points to `"pumpkins"`.

`line 3` 

```
an_array_param << "rutabaga"
```

`an_array_param` is an alias to my_array, `<<` is a mutating method, therefore it can modify the original object referenced by `my_array` and `an_array_param`
