### Question 6

#### What is this code going to output?

```ruby
answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8
```

On `line 7` variable `answer` is being passed to method `mess_with_it`

* Integer objects are immutable in ruby
* `+=` is a non mutating method and returns a new object

Therefore, on `line 9` answer still points to the same object as on `line ` 

Program outputs `34`
