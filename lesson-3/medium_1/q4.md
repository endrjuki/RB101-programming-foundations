### Question 4

```ruby
def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = buffer + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end
```




`rolling_buffer1` method uses `<<` to append `new_element` to `buffer` object. `<<` modifies the object that variable `buffer` references.

`rolling_buffer2` uses `=` assignment. Since variable assignment doesn't mutate the actual object, but just points the variable to a different object in memory, `rolling_buffer2` does not modify the actual `buffer` variable
