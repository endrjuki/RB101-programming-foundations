### Question 9

```ruby
def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end


def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
```

## What would be the return value of the following method invocation?
```ruby
bar(foo)
```

`foo` always returns `'yes'` therefore by passing that to method `bar` (`bar(foo)`) 
local variable `param` gets asigned to `yes`, furthermore `'yes' == 'no'` evalation takes place, and since that expression evaluates to `false`, `else` portion of the ternary operator gets executed, returing `no`
